  Our research is also focused on the development of accelerated acquisition, undersampled reconstruction and motion correction techniques for free-breathing cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for diagnosing cardiovascular disease. We are particularly interested in the application of these methods to 3D whole-heart cardiac MRI and quantitative first-pass myocardial perfusion and their translation into clinical practice.
 

**News:** <font size="3"> We have been awared a 🌟 CaixaResearch Health grant 🌟 to develop quantitative cardiac MRI methods.🎉<br/></font>
